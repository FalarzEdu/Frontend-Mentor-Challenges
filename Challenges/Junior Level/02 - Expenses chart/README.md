## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

For this project I focused on JavaScript, which means I tried more to make the graphs act dynamically along with the user inputs than make the entire thing a visual primacy. I really liked beginning coding with JS with this project, it was a good opportunity to get the basics and even some other intermediate things.

### Useful resources

- [getComputedStyle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle) (JS) - This helped me take the height from the graph bars to change them according to the user input.
